                The myth of the pier
            </h1>
            <p class="text">
                Phileas Fogg was seated squarely in his armehair, his feet close together like those of a grenadier on parade, his hands resting on his knees, 
                his body straight, his head erect: he was steadily watching a complicated clock which indicated the hours, the minutes, the seconds, the days, the months, 
                and the years. At exactly half-past eleven Mr. Fogg would, according to his daily habit, quit Saville Row, and repair to the Reform.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                A rap at this moment sounded on the door of the cosy apartment where Phileas Fogg was seated, and James Forster, the dismissed servant, appeared.
